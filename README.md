## Summary
As basic as to-do apps are, this one actually represented quite the learning curve for me, and I'm grateful for the lessons. In the making of it, I got a better handle on the use of event listeners, increased my familiarity with using the JavaScript console straight from the browser, discovered new properties and a whole lot more. After much beginner's trial and error, my simple to-do application is one that I'm truly very proud of. Ready to take on the next challenge!
